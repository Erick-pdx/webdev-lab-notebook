## Reflection Document

### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

I completed these excersises after tunring in first assignment so doing them
wasnt so hard as I got very familar with html, and I think I looked one thing up
but being as it was more than a week ago I dont remember exactly what it was.

These exercises are okay, however they add way too much work load for a class that
is only 4 credits I feel like I am always behind because even when I am doing the
assignments I forget to do the labs and they just build up.

I think most parts were well explained, I dont really have any complaints on html.

Maybe more html and css combined.

### Accessibility

Enter your reflections on this section here.

I think the accessibility was a good way to understand how websites
need to accomated everyone, and using the accessibility gives us 
as the programmers a better understanding on what we need to do.

I found these exercises really intresting but I felt like there wasnt much information on the different ways to help those who use 
reading software besides labeling areas and pictures.

I felt like everything was explained well, I don't feel there was much to misunderstand.

Maybe if there was more examples of good accessibility websites that would have gave me something to work towards on my websites.

### CSS

CSS is so fun to use, I completed it with help because there is just so many options, however some of them just don't apply to what I am messing with.

Yeah I found the whole thing helpful, I dont think one was more helpful than the other.

I would like it if there was more explained on what options go with certain code, for example which options go with the positioning of the text and which go with the position of a field set.

### Flexbox

I did use some internet help to get the exact specifics correct, however I don't feel like I did them exactly how they were supposed to be done, but there was effort.

I found this not so helpful I would have liked it earlier in the notebook or with hints on what to work with to get the answer although that might make it too easy, but some I was really stuck on because I didnt know what options were wanted.

I wish the options that were required to do this were hinted at before every flexbox because some were obvious and some took a lot of googling to find the options that would help.

No, these exercises were fine, just more information was needed the exercises themselves were pretty good.

### CSS Grid

### Bootstrap

### JavaScript

### Jquery
