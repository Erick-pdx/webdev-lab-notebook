## Reflection Document

### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

I completed these excersises after tunring in first assignment so doing them
wasnt so hard as I got very familar with html, and I think I looked one thing up
but being as it was more than a week ago I dont remember exactly what it was.

These exercises are okay, however they add way too much work load for a class that
is only 4 credits I feel like I am always behind because even when I am doing the
assignments I forget to do the labs and they just build up.

I think most parts were well explained, I dont really have any complaints on html.

Maybe more html and css combined.

### Accessibility

Enter your reflections on this section here.

I think the accessibility was a good way to understand how websites
need to accomated everyone, and using the accessibility gives us
as the programmers a better understanding on what we need to do.

I found these exercises really intresting but I felt like there wasnt much information on the different ways to help those who use
reading software besides labeling areas and pictures.

I felt like everything was explained well, I don't feel there was much to misunderstand.

Maybe if there was more examples of good accessibility websites that would have gave me something to work towards on my websites.

### CSS

CSS is so fun to use, I completed it with help because there is just so many options, however some of them just don't apply to what I am messing with.

Yeah I found the whole thing helpful, I dont think one was more helpful than the other.

I would like it if there was more explained on what options go with certain code, for example which options go with the positioning of the text and which go with the position of a field set.

### Flexbox

I did use some internet help to get the exact specifics correct, however I don't feel like I did them exactly how they were supposed to be done, but there was effort.

I found this not so helpful I would have liked it earlier in the notebook or with hints on what to work with to get the answer although that might make it too easy, but some I was really stuck on because I didnt know what options were wanted.

I wish the options that were required to do this were hinted at before every flexbox because some were obvious and some took a lot of googling to find the options that would help.

No, these exercises were fine, just more information was needed the exercises themselves were pretty good.

### CSS Grid

I could do the first box with a little help from the soltutions however, when it came to the second part the way I was thinking of solving it was not the way in the soltions and it was beyond what I knew, so I am glad I know of the soltions now because this was a little outside of expertise.

I think this was helpful I just want parts explained because I dont remember going over this in the slides,

### Bootstrap

I was able to complete the middle two by myself, however the first and last I needed help, and used the solutions.

I found these exercises helpful as I dont really understand boot strap I get how to use it however the concept is a little confusing.

We missed the lecture for bootstrap and I need to review it, since I watched it in video form, my understanding isnt that great.

I think these exercises was fine, they were short and sweet.

### JavaScript

Not gonna lie I used a lot of help in this section because I am just learning it in lecture.

I found these exercises really intresting and I will probably review them before the final, what I found intresting was the way replace worked and mostly dom where it copied the typed in text at the same speed it was being written.

I wished the java script files had htmls just so I could see what was going or an examplanation how to see the output I just had to guess I was doing the correct code and compare with the given code.

I don't know many other exercises but the ones that had to do with game of thrones were really fun to do.

### Jquery

Honestly I had most of the assignments up at the same time and don't remember doing this one, or at least the second one, but the results I've definetly seen before, I wanna say that I did use the help from the solutions.

I found this one intresting because it was similar to a js exercise that we did, so the results were expected I feel I still dont understand jquery even after re doing the exercise.

I with this entire part was explained so rather than just saying do this say this is the topic and your learning this...

More exercises in general would have been good, to practise nothing long just short functions where I can see the outcomes and such.

### Update for Jquery

I didnt read the instuctions and thought it was completed because it is the same as the js fetch, now that I know it I can aswer it.

There wasn't any solutions so I used online resources to get the hang of it but I can see the patter from
js to jquery as most lines translated the same way to jquery.

I found this sections intresting and it wasn't hard, but it gave me better insight to jquery but my understanding is still low and for the most part I am thinking how this so similar to js so why not just keep using js.

I think this part needs a solutions for it, but other than that its pretty self explanitory, overall not a bad practise especially as we head towards the final.

I just doing a more simple js to jquery than heading to this one would have been better, but besides that the learning curve wasnt very hard.
