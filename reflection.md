I completed these excersises after tunring in first assignment so doing them
wasnt so hard as I got very familar with html, and I think I looked one thing up
but being as it was more than a week ago I dont remember exactly what it was.

These exercises are okay, however they add way too much work load for a class that
is only 4 credits I feel like I am always behind because even when I am doing the
assignments I forget to do the labs and they just build up.

I think most parts were well explained, I dont really have any complaints on html.

Maybe more html and css combined.
